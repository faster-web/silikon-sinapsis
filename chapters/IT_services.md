#### Article: Strategy is Different in Service Businesses
\label{subsubsec: Strategy-is-Different-in-Service-Businesses}

Many managers of service businesses are aware that the _strategic management_ (by which I mean the total process of selecting and implementing a corporate strategy) of _service businesses_ is _different_ from that of _manufacturing businesses_. This article discusses how pure service businesses are different from product-oriented businesses and why they require different strategic thinking. A _pure service business_ is one in which the _service is the primary entity that is sold_.

That distinction is important because everyone in every type of business sells some element of service. In pure service businesses any transfer of a physical or concrete product is incidental to the serviceâ€”for example, the written report of a management consultant. Examples of pure service businesses include _airlines, banks, computer service bureaus, law firms, plumbing repair companies, motion picture theaters_, and _management consulting firms_.

Top managers should ask themselves _six questions about strategic management_. The questions are fairly common, but the answers for service businesses are often unique. Each question will be raised here and discussed in depth later.

**Do we fully understand the specific type of service business we are in?** Although service-oriented businesses are different from product-oriented businesses, the nature of the difference depends a great deal on the specific type of service business. I will present a classification scheme to help distinguish between service businesses along some important strategic dimensions.

**How can we defend our business from competitors?** Every business must consider how it can build and protect a strong competitive position. To do this, the economics of the business must be carefully analyzed. Service businesses often require different competitive strategies from those of product-oriented companies. If an enduring institution is to be created, some attention must be given to the management of economies of scale, proprietary technology, and reputation of the company.

**How can we obtain more cost-efficient operations?** Manufacturing companies can improve operating leverage by, for example, purchasing faster and more reliable machinery. But most service businesses are not able to follow this approach. Other methods must be explored.

**What is the rationale for our pricing strategy?** The pricing of services is a nebulous area. Cost-based pricing is often difficult to determine, and there are few formulas for effective value-based pricing. It is important to look at pricing strategy and think about the economic and psychological effects of a change in that strategy.

**What process are we using to develop and test new services?** Every company depends on an ability to renew its franchise in the marketplace. The service-oriented company must pay particular attention to this area because of the difficulty of developing protectable competitive positions. The process of new-service development and testing must recognize the abstract, perishable nature of services.

**What acquisitions, if any, would make sense for our company?** Once the nature of the current business is understood, the acquisition question can be faced. The acquisition game in the service sector can be dangerous. More than one company has acquired a service business using only criteria that would be used in the acquisition of a product-oriented company. As several of these companies have learned, this type of analysis, although necessary, is insufficient.
